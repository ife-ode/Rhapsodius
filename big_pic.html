                Rhapsodius (Andrew Craig) creates and performs original music, develops, directs and produces large-scale multi-disciplinary and multimedia productions, creates and produces audio and video content for traditional and new media, and teaches music at SJK School in Breslau, ON. He’s worked with artists such as Molly Johnson, Wynton Marsalis, Measha Bruggergosman and Jackie Richardson, opened for Bobby McFerrin, musical-directed tributes to Oscar Peterson and Quincy Jones, and performed twice for Nelson Mandela. 

Rhapsodius worked as a national broadcaster for the CBC for nearly a decade, in addition to hosting high-profile events for organizations such as the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the Glenn Gould Foundation. Andrew composed and produced music for the 3-year countdown event as well as the Daily Victory Celebrations of the Toronto 2015 Pan/Para Am Games.
<br>
<br>
<br>

In 2013, Rhapsodius founded Culchahworks Arts Collective, a Toronto-based organization that celebrates stories drawn principally from the African-Canadian, Caribbean-Canadian and African-American cultural legacies, having universal resonance. Culchahworks has paid large-scale tribute to such icons as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Bob Marley, and Harry Belafonte. In 2018, Culchahworks premiered “Portraits, Patterns, Possibilities: A Black Canadian Trilogy” – three original plays Andrew wrote, directed and produced. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

Through Culchahworks, Rhapsodius founded the Can.You.Read.Festival in 2016, addressing the twin issues of literacy and food security. The Festival has already donated thousands of pounds of food and thousands of books to needy families throughout the GTA. Andrew also created and directed the Warriors Chorus programme in 2013 – a heritage reclamation project for at-risk boys and young men of colour. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

2019 saw three artistic milestones: Rhapsodius produced and directed the wildly-successful “Titans Of Toronto Reggae” concert, which brought together 16 of the now-legendary Reggae artists who had their start in Toronto’s Little Jamaica. The event was so significant that the Mayor of Toronto, John Tory, declared March 2 “Titans of Toronto Reggae Day”. Andrew produced the Workshop Presentation of his fourth stage play “Fish And Rum”, which is being developed into an online episodic series.
<br>
<br>
<br>

In 2022, Culchahworks released the full-length film version of Rhapsodius’ “Chloe=Catalyst”, the story of Chloe Cooley - the woman at the centre of the drama that would yield the first anti-slavery legislation passed anywhere in the British empire. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
In 2023, Rhapsodius composed an original score for the Stratford Festival’s Production of “Richard II”, to favourable reviews. That same year, he received a commission to create a brand-new arrangement of Oscar Peterson’s iconic “Hymn To Freedom” for the National Arts Centre Orchestra. The arrangement debuted on Canada Day, and will be performed every July 1 by the orchestra, moving forward.
<br>
<br>
<br>
In 2024, Rhapsodius workshopped his fifth play, “Keeping Up With The Joneses”, about the lives of Black Canadian Civil Rights activists Rocky and Joan Jones, and Walter Borden. The play will be fully mounted in 2026, in collaboration with Neptune Theatre. Rhapsodius also debuted his first one-person hybrid music/theatre show, “War & Peace: Songs And Monologues”.
