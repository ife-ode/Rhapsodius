                Rhapsodius - literally, “made of rhapsody” - is a confluence of 
                things. Singer, multi-instrumentalist, composer, arranger, director, 
                producer, playwright, educator, activist - all these rivers, and more, 
                flow one into the other to create this artist whose boundary-crossing 
                work defies convention. Artists aren’t supposed to do all of these things - 
                and yet, Rhapsodius moves between disciplines and styles with ease. 
                Rhapsodius has worked with a who’s who of artists in music, theatre, 
                dance, and film, both in Canada and abroad. He has directed high-profile 
                tributes to icons Quincy Jones and Oscar Peterson, opened for Bobby McFerrin, 
                and performed for Nelson Mandela - twice.

                Deeply and equally schooled in the Western European Art music tradition 
                and various branches of African Diasporic music, and unwaveringly dedicated 
                to groove, Rhapsodius brings new sounds, images, and ideas into the space - 
                that are everything you know and nothing you recognize, all at once. 
                A dedicated artivist (artist + activist) in the lineage of Harry Belafonte, 
                Ai Weiwei and Banksy, Rhapsodius dedicates himself to the creation of art that 
                intentionally edifies, provokes thought, discussion, and dialogue, challenges conventions, 
                and hopefully, inspires positive change in the world.
